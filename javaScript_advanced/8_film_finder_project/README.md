# Film Finder

You’ve caught up on your list of TV shows and movies and want to get recommendations for what to watch next, but aren’t sure where to look. In this project, you’ll:

- use your knowledge of HTTP requests and asynchronous JavaScript
- create a movie discovery app that will recommend random movies by genre.
- You’ll be able to choose from several genres,
- and like or dislike a movie to get another suggestion. OPTIONAL.

Before you begin, you’ll need to <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/signup">create an account</a>
on The Movie Database website. After you create your account and verify your email address, click on your user icon at the top right corner and navigate to the Settings page.

After you finish this project, feel free to challenge yourself to continue building it out. For example,

- you might recommend TV shows instead of movies,
- or change the information you present about the recommended movies.

The possibilities are endless.

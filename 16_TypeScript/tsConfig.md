# The tsconfig.json File

The `tsconfig.json` file in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html) allows you to configure how the TypeScript compiler behaves for your project.

- `compilerOptions`: This section contains rules and settings for the TypeScript compiler.
  - `target`: Specifies the ECMAScript version to compile down to, like `"es2017"`.
  - `module`: Specifies the module system, like `"commonjs"` for Node.js.
  - `strictNullChecks`: Enforces strict checking for null and undefined values.
- `include`: An array that determines which TypeScript files to apply the rules to. For instance, `["**/*.ts"]` includes all `.ts` files.
- Other options: There are many more options to customize TypeScript's behavior.

The `tsconfig.json` file helps ensure consistency and provides flexibility by allowing you to choose the rules you want to enforce. It's placed in the project's root and enables you to run `tsc` without arguments to compile according to the specified settings.

By using `tsconfig.json`, you can streamline development and ensure consistent code quality, making it useful for individual and team projects.

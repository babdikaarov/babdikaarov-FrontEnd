# Introduction to Arrays in TS

In TypeScript, dealing with arrays comes with a different aspect of typing. Unlike primitive types, arrays contain multiple pieces of data, so tracking the types of elements within arrays becomes important. For instance:

firstArray contains elements of the number type.
secondArray has elements of different types: number, string, and array.
Although both arrays are valid in JavaScript, TypeScript offers easy ways to manage element types in arrays. However, let's imagine the challenge of maintaining type consistency without TypeScript's array typing features. How challenging would it be?

## Array Type Annotations

The TypeScript type annotation for array types is fairly straightforward: we put [] after the element type. In this code, names is an Array that can only contain strings:

```ts
let names: string[] = ['Danny', 'Samantha'];
```

An alternative method is to use the Array`<T>` syntax, where T stands for the type.

```ts
let names: Array<string> = ['Danny', 'Samantha'];
```

In the code above, the type, T, is string. We won’t use Array`<T>` syntax in this lesson, but it’s nice to be familiar with it.

As we may expect, we get a type error if we try to assign an array of numbers to a string[] variable:

```ts
let names: string[] = [1,2,3]; // Type Error!
```

That was just like an assignment error with primitive types. TypeScript arrays, however, can also throw errors when elements of the wrong type are added:

```ts
let names: string[] = ['Damien'];
names.push(666) // Type Error!
```

## Multi-dimensional Arrays

So far we’ve looked at string[] arrays, but we could also have arrays that only contain numbers (number[]) or booleans (boolean[]). In fact, we can make arrays of any type whatsoever. We can also declare multidimensional arrays: arrays of arrays (of some type).

```ts
let arr: string[][] = [['str1', 'str2'], ['more', 'strings']];
```

Think of the string[][] above as short for (string[])[], that is, an array where every element has type string[]. We’ll explore more complex array types in later lessons.

The empty array ([]) is compatible with any array type:

```ts
let names: string[] = []; // No type errors.
let numbers: number[] = []; // No type errors.
names.push('Isabella');  
numbers.push(30);
```

## Tuples

So far we’ve looked at arrays with all elements of the same type. But, as we know, JavaScript arrays are flexible and can have elements of different types. With TypeScript, we can also define arrays with a fixed sequence of types:

```ts
let ourTuple: [string, number, string, boolean] = ['Is', 7 , 'our favorite number?' , false];
```

In TypeScript, when an array is typed with elements of specific types, it’s called a tuple. The tuple above (ourTuple) contains the elements: 'Is', 7 , 'our favorite number?' , false and the tuple has a type of [string, number, string, boolean]. Tuple types specify both the lengths and the orders of compatible tuples, and will cause an error if either of these conditions are not met:

```ts
let numbersTuple: [number, number, number] = [1,2,3,4]; // Type Error! numbersTuple should only have three elements.
let mixedTuple: [number, string, boolean] = ['hi', 3, true] // Type Error! The first elements should be a number, the second a string, and the third a boolean.
```

As far as JavaScript is concerned, tuples act just like arrays. They both have .length properties. We can access (or change) the elements of both using [index]. But despite their similarities, tuples and arrays do not have compatible types within TypeScript. Specifically, we can’t assign an array to a tuple variable, even when the elements are of the correct type:

```ts
let tup: [string, string] = ['hi', 'bye'];
let arr: string[] = ['there','there'];
tup = ['there', 'there']; // No Errors.
tup = arr; // Type Error! An array cannot be assigned to a tuple.
```

## Array Type Inference

TypeScript can infer variable types from initial values and return statements. Even still, we may not know exactly what type inference to expect when dealing with arrays. For example:

```ts
let examAnswers= [true, false, false];
```

What is the type of examAnswers? It seems it could equally well be boolean[] or [boolean, boolean, boolean]. In reality, it is always the first of these, since this is the less restrictive type. This enables us to expand the array:

```ts
examAnswers[3] = true; // No type error.
```

Since tuples have fixed lengths, we wouldn’t be able to add additional boolean elements to a tuple:

```ts
let tupleOfExamAnswers: [boolean, boolean, boolean] = [true, false, false];
tupleOfExamAnswers[3] = true; // Type error! The tuple only has 3 elements.
```

We also get the same kind of type inference when we use the .concat() method:

```ts
let tup: [number, number, number] = [1,2,3];
let concatResult = tup.concat([4,5,6]); // concatResult has the value [1,2,3,4,5,6].
```

In the code above, TypeScript infers the variable concatResult as an array of numbers, not a tuple.

The takeaway here is that type inference returns arrays. When we want tuples, we need to use explicit type annotations.

## Rest Parameters

Assigning types to rest parameters is similar to assigning types to arrays. Here’s a rest parameter example without types:

```ts
function smush(firstString, ...otherStrings){
  let output = firstString;
  for(let i = 0; i < otherStrings.length; i++){
    output = output.concat(otherStrings[i]);
  }
  return output;
}
```

This function concatenates all of its arguments. For example, calling: smush('hi ', 'there') returns the value 'hi there'.” The rest parameter otherStrings lets the function work with any number of parameters greater than zero:

```ts
smush('a','h','h','H','H','H','!','!'); // Returns: 'ahhHHH!!'.
```

The function works well, but it is not type safe. We don’t want a misguided coder to make a mistake like smush(1,2,3), when that would cause an error. TypeScript to the rescue! Type annotations for a rest parameter are identical to type annotations for arrays. The function with a correctly typed rest parameter is then:

```ts
function smush(firstString, ...otherStrings: string[]){
  /*rest of function*/
}
```

With this change, TypeScript will treat otherStrings as an array of strings. This means that smush(1,2,3) will result in a type error because [2,3] is not an array of strings.

## Spread Syntax

Like the finest wines and cheeses, TypeScript’s tuples pair beautifully with JavaScript’s spread syntax. This is most useful for function calls that use lots of arguments, like this:

```ts
function gpsNavigate(startLatitudeDegrees:number, startLatitudeMinutes:number, startNorthOrSouth:string, startLongitudeDegrees: number, startLongitudeMinutes: number, startEastOrWest:string, endLatitudeDegrees:number, endLatitudeMinutes:number , endNorthOrSouth:string, endLongitudeDegrees: number, endLongitudeMinutes: number,  endEastOrWest:string) {
  /*navigation subroutine here*/
}
```

The function call gpsNavigate(40, 43.2, 'N', 73, 59.8, 'W', 25, 0, 'N', 71, 0, 'W') calculates a route from the Codecademy offices in New York City (40 degrees 43.2 minutes north, 73 degrees 59.8 minutes west) to selected coordinates in the Bermuda Triangle. We all agree that this function call is awkward to read.

Instead, we can use tuple variables that represent the starting and ending coordinates:

```ts
let codecademyCoordinates: [number, number, string, number, number, string] = [40, 43.2, 'N', 73, 59.8, 'W'];
let bermudaTCoordinates: [number, number, string, number, number, string] = [25, 0 , 'N' , 71, 0, 'W'];
```

These tuple type annotations guarantee that the types of the elements will be valid function parameters for gpsNavigate().

Now, we use JavaScript’s spread syntax to write a very readable function call:

```ts
gpsNavigate(...codecademyCoordinates, ...bermudaTCoordinates);
// And by the way, this makes the return trip really convenient to compute too:
gpsNavigate(...bermudaTCoordinates, ...codecademyCoordinates);
// If there is a return trip . . .
```

# Union

TypeScript provides a range of type specificity for variables. You can be very specific, like ensuring a variable is a string, or very unspecific by using the "any" type, which accepts any value without complaint.

However, sometimes you need a balance between extreme specificity and total unspecificity. For instance, when dealing with employee IDs that can be either a string or a number. In such cases, TypeScript allows you to create flexible types by combining different types, forming what's called a union. This helps ensure your variables can accept a limited set of valid types.

## Defining Unions

Unions allow us to define multiple allowed type members by separating each type member with a vertical line character |. With a union, we can re-type the program from the previous exercise like this:

```ts
let ID: string | number;

// number
ID = 1;

// or string
ID = '001';

console.log(`The ID is ${ID}.`);
```

In this example,`string | number` is a union that allows ID to be a string or a number. It’s more flexible than a single primitive type, but much more specific than the any type.

Unions can be written anywhere a type value is defined, including function parameters:

```ts
function getMarginLeft(margin: string | number) {
  return { 'marginLeft': margin };
}
```

Using unions to type function parameters is especially convenient because functions often need to handle multiple types of input.

## Type Narrowing

Typing with unions gives us more flexibility with type specificity, but there’s also more to consider. For instance, look over this union:

```ts
function getMarginLeft(margin: string | number) {
  // ...
}
```

Since margin can be a string or a number, we may want to perform different logic in the getMarginLeft() function’s body that does one thing for strings and another for numbers. To do this, we could implement a type guard. A type guard is a conditional that checks if a variable is a certain type, like this:

```ts
function getMarginLeft(margin: string | number) {
  // margin may be a string or number here
  
  if (typeof margin === 'string') {
    // margin must be a string here
  }
}
```

In the example above, TypeScript is able to read the type guard and infer that the margin variable inside the type guard must be a string. Since TypeScript knows margin is a string, it will allow us to use string methods on margin, like this:

```ts
if (typeof margin === 'string') {
  return margin.toLowerCase();
}
```

If we tried to call margin.toLowerCase() outside of the string type guard, TypeScript would complain that the .toLowerCase() method does not exist on number types. This error would occur because margin is typed as a string | number union.

This concept is called type narrowing. Type narrowing is when TypeScript can figure out what type a variable can be at a given point in our code. In our examples, TypeScript has narrowed the type inside the type guard to only be a string. Type narrowing allows us to use unions, then perform type-specific logic without TypeScript getting in the way.

## Inferred Union Return Types

One of the awesome things about TypeScript is that it’s able to infer types in many cases so that we don’t have to manually write them. A great example is a function’s return type. TypeScript will look at the contents of a function and infer which types the function can return. If there are multiple possible return types, TypeScript will infer the return type as a union.

For instance, take this example, where we call a function named getBookFromServer(), which might fail:

```ts
function getBook() {
  try {
    return getBookFromServer();
  } catch (error) {
    return `Something went wrong: ${error}`;
  }
}
```

If the call is successful, the function will return a Book type describing a book. If the call fails, the function will return a string. getBook() can return a Book or string type, TypeScript infers the return type as the union Book | string. Since TypeScript can infer the function’s return type, there’s no need for us to manually define it.

## Unions and Arrays

Unions are even more powerful when used in combination with arrays.

For instance, we can represent time in TypeScript with a number or a string type. If we had a list of dates in both types, we’d need an array that allows for string and number values. Unions are here to help.

To create a union that supports multiple types for an array’s values, wrap the union in parentheses `(string | number)`, then use array notation [].

```ts
const dateNumber = new Date().getTime(); // returns a number
const dateString = new Date().toString(); // returns a string

const timesList: (string | number)[] = [dateNumber, dateString];
```

Above, the timesList variable is typed to allow string and number types as values in its array. If we try to add a value to timesList that is not either type, like with `timesList.push(true)`, TypeScript would display an error that boolean types are not allowed inside timesList.

One last thing: the parentheses are vitally important to type arrays correctly. If we left out the parentheses and wrote`string | number[]`, that type would allow strings or arrays of only numbers.

## Common Key Value Pairs

When we put type members in a union, TypeScript will only allow us to use the common methods and properties that all members of the union share. Take this code:

```ts
const batteryStatus: boolean | number = false;

batteryStatus.toString(); // No TypeScript error
batteryStatus.toFixed(2); // TypeScript error
```

Since batteryStatus can be a boolean or a number, TypeScript will only allow us to call methods that both number and boolean share. They both share .toString(), so we’re good there. But, since only number has a .toFixed() method, TypeScript will complain if we try to call it.

This rule also applies to type objects that we define. Take this code:

```ts
type Goose = {
  isPettable: boolean;
  hasFeathers: boolean;
  canThwartAPicnic: boolean;
}

type Moose = {
  isPettable: boolean;
  hasHoofs: boolean;
}

const pettingZooAnimal: Goose | Moose = { isPettable: true };

console.log(pettingZooAnimal.isPettable); // No TypeScript error
console.log(pettingZooAnimal.hasHoofs); // TypeScript error
```

Like before, since .isPettable is on both Goose and Moose types, TypeScript will allow us to call it. But since .hasHoofs is only a property on Moose, we cannot call that method on pettingZooAnimal. Any properties or methods that are not shared by all of the union’s members won’t be allowed and will produce a TypeScript error.

## Unions with Literal Types

We can use literal types with TypeScript unions. Literal type unions are useful when we want to create distinct states within a program.

For instance, if we were writing the code that controlled stoplights, we might write a program like this:

```ts
type Color = 'green' | 'yellow' | 'red';

function changeLight(color: Color) {
  // ...
}
```

With the code above, we could ensure that wherever changeLight() is called, that it gets passed only allowed stoplight colors. If we tried to call changeLight('purple'), TypeScript would complain, since that is not a valid stoplight color.

This technique allows us to write functions that are specific about the states they can handle, which helps us write code that’s less prone to errors.

## Review

Unions in TypeScript are a way to combine multiple types using the vertical bar character "|". They allow us to be flexible with our type definitions and handle situations where a variable can have multiple possible types. Type narrowing helps us refine the type within a union to access specific methods and properties. When a function can return multiple types, TypeScript creates a union of all possible return types. Unions can also be used to allow arrays to contain multiple types of values. However, when calling methods or properties on a union-typed variable, we can only use those that are common to all members of the union. Unions, combined with literal types, are useful for defining different states within our programs.

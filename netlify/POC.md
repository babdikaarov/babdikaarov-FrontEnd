# POC

Proof of Concept (POC), also known as Proof of Principle, which is a realization of a method or idea to demonstrate its feasibility. A POC serves as a demonstration or validation of a concept or theory to verify its practical potential. It is usually a small-scale and may not be fully complete.

In various fields, including filmmaking, engineering, business development, security, software development, and drug development, POCs are used to explore and assess the viability of new ideas, technologies, or solutions. For example, in software development, a POC can help choose the best technology stack, attract investors, and gather valuable feedback from the target audience before building the full-scale product.

## Proof of Concept (POC)

- Definition: A POC is a small-scale, experimental project or demonstration used to verify the technical feasibility or viability of a specific idea, concept, or technology. It aims to test whether a certain approach or technology can work as intended.
- Focus: POCs focus on validating the underlying technology, principle, or mechanism behind an idea. They are primarily concerned with proving that a concept can be implemented and that it achieves the desired results.
Scope: POCs are usually limited in scope and may not be complete or fully functional. They are meant to provide a basic understanding of how the concept works without necessarily delivering the full value or functionality of the final product.
- Timeframe: POCs are relatively short-term experiments designed to assess technical feasibility. They help in making decisions on whether to proceed with further development or explore alternative approaches.
- Audience: POCs are often conducted within the development team or technical experts. They may not involve end-users or customers.

# Vite

## getting started

```bash
npm i vite
```

## build commands

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "serve": "vite preview"
}
```

## JSX

If js contains `JSX` the file extention should be `.jsx`

```js
// from app.js / app.ts
// to app.jsx / app.tsx
```

## running commands

```bash
# will run your project in prebundled mode where no dist dir created 
npm start

# will build your project to production ready dist dir created
npm run build

# will run on server the production built project (created dist dir)
npm run serve
```

After ruuning server (start | serve) the terminal has interface where you can interact cool feature.

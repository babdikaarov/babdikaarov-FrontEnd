# Debugging Memory Issues in JavaScript

## How memory issues can impact performance and end-user experience

When your code has memory leaks or you try to use more memory than is available for your program, it can cause websites to slow down and crash. Accidentally introducing memory leaks into your application can be as easy as either of these scenarios:

Adding an event listener but never removing it
Adding variables to the global object
When you set objects as data on a DOM element, it can lead you to use more memory than is available, or can even lead to a memory leak if you never remove the DOM object. (For example, you might render a modal box off-screen and keep it there.) When that happens in production, your end users experience the impact.

To find the source of memory issues, we have to consider questions like:

From where was memory allocated?
Why wasn’t some piece of memory garbage collected?
How is memory usage growing over time?
Browser tools provide options for answering these questions.

## Developer Tools that can help you debug memory issues

Most browsers, including Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, have built-in tools you can use to debug and test your code. While those tools all have feature parity, here we’ll look specifically at the Memory Panel in Chrome’s Developer Tools, “DevTools”, which provides information on how memory is being used.

There are a few different tools available in the Memory Inspector:

Heap Snapshot: This tool shows you how memory is distributed among a page’s JavaScript objects and related DOM nodes.
Allocation instrumentation on timeline: This tool shows JavaScript memory allocations over time, and can be used to isolate memory leaks.
Allocation sampling: We can use this to record memory allocations using a sampling method. This tool is best for long-running operations.
Heap Snapshot
Heap snapshots are great to use when debugging memory issues, because you can see what is taking up memory at a given time and compare between times. This view shows:

What objects are in memory
Details about the objects that are in memory, like the constructor function that was used to make the object
How objects reference each other
The size of memory objects are using
What’s been added or failed to be garbage collected between snapshots
The Heap Snapshot tab has 4 different views:

Summary view: This view groups objects by constructor and can be used to track down DOM leaks.
Comparison view: This displays the difference between Heap snapshots. So if you use more memory or have memory garbage collected between snapshots, you can identify if you have a memory leak based on reference counts and change in freed memory. Note that this view will only be available if you have 2 or more heap snapshots saved in the DevTools Memory Panel.
Containment view: This view is helpful for analyzing objects referenced in the global namespace (Window) to track down why they are not being garbage collected.
Statistics view: This shows a breakdown of how memory is being used based on various categories, like Code, Strings, and JS arrays.
Allocation Instrumentation on Timeline
You can use the allocation timeline to identify objects that aren’t being garbage collected when they should be and therefore remain in memory. It is a combination of details you’d find in the heap snapshot, but with the addition of timeline tracking that takes updated snapshots as frequently as every 50 ms. You can use the allocation timeline by making a recording and performing page actions while the recording is underway.

This view shows:

Where objects were allocated during code execution
How often garbage is being collected
Allocation Sampling
Allocation sampling is similar to the allocation timeline, but has lower performance overhead. Snapshots are taken as a sample of the stack trace rather than with a regular cadence as they are when using the allocation timeline. You can use allocation sampling when you need to record snapshots for long-running operations and use the stack trace to identify where allocations are originating.

This view shows:

What lines of code are creating garbage for the garbage collector
What lines of code are allocating new heap memory

**Debugging Memory Issues in JavaScript**

Memory issues in JavaScript can slow down or crash websites, often caused by memory leaks. Identifying memory problems is crucial for maintaining good user experiences.

**Tools for Debugging:**

- Browser developer tools, like Chrome's DevTools, help find memory problems.
- **Memory Inspector** in DevTools offers insights:
  - **Heap Snapshot**: Shows memory distribution among JavaScript objects.
  - **Allocation Instrumentation on Timeline**: Identifies memory allocations over time.
  - **Allocation Sampling**: Records memory allocations efficiently.

**Practical Steps:**

- **Heap Snapshot**: Reveals objects in memory, their sizes, references, and changes.
- **Allocation Instrumentation**: Tracks allocations during page actions.
- **Allocation Sampling**: Samples stack traces for allocation origins.
- **Performance Tab**: Monitors frame rate (fps) and identifies bottlenecks.

**Lab Activities:**

1. Simulate memory allocation with buttons.
2. Analyze performance and fps in the Performance tab.
3. Check for warnings in the Main thread activity flame chart.
4. Resolve issues like "Forced reflow."
5. Locate slow code execution lines in your source code.

These tools and techniques help developers find and fix memory issues, ensuring better website performance.

**Title: Fixing Memory Leaks with Chrome DevTools**

**Introduction:**
Memory leaks can cause performance issues in web applications. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to identify and fix memory leaks using Google Chrome DevTools.

**Prerequisites:**

- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and web development.
- Google Chrome browser installed.

**Step 1: Identify a Potential Memory Leak**

1. Open your web application in Google Chrome.
2. Open DevTools by right-clicking on your page and selecting "Inspect" or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I` (on Mac).
3. Navigate to the "Memory" tab in DevTools.

**Step 2: Record a Heap Snapshot**

1. Click the "Start Recording" button in the "Memory" tab.
2. Interact with your web application as you normally would, especially actions that might trigger memory leaks.
3. Click the "Stop Recording" button to capture a heap snapshot.

**Step 3: Analyze the Heap Snapshot**

1. In the "Summary" panel, you'll see a list of objects and their memory usage.
2. Look for objects that are growing in size between snapshots, as this may indicate a memory leak.

**Step 4: Find Retained Domains**

1. Scroll down to the "Detached DOM Trees" section.
2. Click on "Show retained objects," which will display objects keeping detached DOM trees in memory.
3. Examine these objects to identify the source of the memory leak.

**Step 5: Inspect Code and Variables**

1. Go to the "Profiles" tab in DevTools.
2. Select "Take heap snapshot" to capture a new snapshot.
3. In the "Comparison" view, compare the two snapshots.
4. Look for objects that persist between snapshots but shouldn't.
5. Click on objects to view their references and the code that creates them.

**Step 6: Fix the Memory Leak**

1. Identify the part of your code that is causing the leak.
2. Review your code to find out why these objects aren't being cleaned up properly.
3. Ensure you remove event listeners, clear intervals, or nullify references when objects are no longer needed.
4. Test your changes in your application to confirm the memory leak is fixed.

**Step 7: Verify the Fix**

1. Re-record heap snapshots to confirm that the memory leak is resolved.
2. Monitor memory usage over time to ensure it remains stable.

**Conclusion:**
By using Chrome DevTools to identify and fix memory leaks, you can significantly improve the performance and stability of your web applications. Regularly profiling your code and addressing memory issues is crucial for delivering a smooth user experience.

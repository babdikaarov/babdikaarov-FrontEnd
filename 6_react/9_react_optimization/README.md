# Optimizing React Application

[this](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html) legacy documentation for how to optimize react

- Use React Profiler: React Profiler is a built-in tool that helps you identify performance bottlenecks by measuring component render times. It allows you to visualize when components render, re-render, and update, helping you optimize the rendering process.

- [Memoization](https://react.dev/reference/react/memo#skipping-re-rendering-when-props-are-unchanged): Use the React.memo higher-order component to memoize functional components. This prevents unnecessary re-renders by only updating components when their props have changed.

- Virtualization: For long lists or grids, use virtualization libraries like react-virtualized or react-window to render only the visible items, improving rendering and scrolling performance.

- Code Splitting: Split your code into smaller chunks using tools like React.lazy and React.Suspense. This allows you to load only the necessary components when they are needed, reducing the initial bundle size.

- Server-side Rendering (SSR): Implement SSR using tools like Next.js or Razzle. SSR reduces the time it takes for the user to see the content and improves SEO by serving fully rendered pages directly from the server.

- Optimize Images: Compress and optimize images before using them in your application. Lazy-load images that are not immediately visible on the screen to improve page load times.

- State Management: Choose an efficient state management solution based on your application's needs. For example, if your app has complex state management requirements, consider using Redux with selectors to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

Remember that performance optimization is an ongoing process, and it's important to measure the impact of each optimization technique. Use tools like Chrome DevTools' Performance tab and Lighthouse to analyze and monitor your application's performance.

## Fast Load Times

## Lighthouse

[This is helpful](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) if you want to monitor and produce reports on the performance of your website using Chrome DevTools, a Node.js command line tool or a standalone Chrome extension.

Use this tool as a readily available resource to audit the performance of your websites!

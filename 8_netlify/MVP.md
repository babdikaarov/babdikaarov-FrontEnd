# MVP

The concept of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), which is a product development strategy focused on releasing a version of a product with the minimum necessary features to be usable by early customers. The primary purpose of an MVP is to gather feedback from these early users, which helps in refining and developing the product further. The term was coined in 2001 and popularized by Steve Blank and Eric Ries.

An MVP is developed with just enough core features to deploy the product effectively. It is then released to a subset of potential customers, typically early adopters who are more forgiving and likely to provide valuable feedback. The strategy aims to avoid building products that customers don't want and reduce wasted engineering hours. The Lean Startup methodology, which emphasizes validated learning, is closely associated with MVPs.

The key purposes of an MVP include testing a product hypothesis with minimal resources, accelerating learning, reducing risk, and getting the product to early customers quickly. It is especially useful for startups to validate their business ideas and market needs before making substantial investments. Testing is a crucial aspect of MVPs, and the strategy seeks to evaluate if the initial problem or goal is solved in a manner that justifies further development.

Releasing an MVP is a market testing strategy used to validate whether the market wants the product before investing significant time and resources. The MVP approach differs from traditional market testing, as it focuses on early feedback and iterative development based on customer input. It can be used in conjunction with the Business Model Canvas to validate different aspects of a business idea, such as customers, value proposition, channels, and relationships.

The article also mentions some criticism of the MVP approach, such as the risk of imitation by competitors and potential negative effects on a company's reputation. Additionally, in some environments, where intellectual property protection is limited, the MVP approach may not be well-suited due to the ease of imitation.

Overall, the Minimum Viable Product strategy is a powerful tool for entrepreneurs and product developers to validate their ideas, gather feedback, and reduce risks associated with product development.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

- Definition: An MVP is a functional version of a product or service with the minimum set of features required to satisfy early adopters or customers. It aims to gather feedback and learning from real users to validate assumptions and guide future development.
- Focus: MVPs focus on the customer value and addressing specific pain points. They aim to test the market demand and validate the product-market fit, rather than just technical feasibility.
- Scope: MVPs are more complete than POCs and include enough features to deliver real value to users. They are a starting point for iterative development and refinement based on user feedback.
- Timeframe: MVPs are designed for medium-term validation and learning. They are released to early customers or users to gather feedback and assess whether the product meets their needs.
- Audience: MVPs involve real end-users or customers who interact with the product and provide feedback. The goal is to learn from their usage patterns and preferences to improve the product further.
